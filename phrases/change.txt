I watched you change
Into a fly
I looked away
You were on fire

[Chorus]
And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

[Verse 2]
I took you home
Set you on the glass
I pulled off your wings
Then I laughed

[Chorus]
And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

[Bridge]
It's like you never had wings
Ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 3]
I look at the cross
Then I look away
Give you the gun
Blow me away

[Chorus]
And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

[Verse 4]
Now you feel alive
You feel alive
You feel alive
I've watched you change
It's like you never had wings
Ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah

[Outro]
You've changed
You've changed
You've changed
Into a fly
