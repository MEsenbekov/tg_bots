[Intro]
Floating underwater
Ever-changing picture
Hours out from land
In tune with all our dreams

[Verse 1]
The ocean takes me in
To watch you shake it
Watch you wave your powers
Tempt with hours of pleasure

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

[Chorus]
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight-ight
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight (We ride)

[Verse 2]
Cruising through the city
After hours with me
Fusing all our powers
Here's to all our dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

[Chorus]
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight-ight
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight (We ride)
